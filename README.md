# World Maps Extended
This is a Runelite plugin to compliment the existing Runelite 'World Map' client plugin, but to operate in a different way. This plugin gives significant flexibility to how you want to view the world map - remove as many icons as you want, to view the world map in your own way. This plugin can therefore work in conjunction with the 'World Map' plugin, allowing as much or as little detail to be retained.

There are areas where this plugin can be improved or developed further, however the intent would not be to duplicate the existing 'World Map' client plugin options.
